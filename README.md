# Waves in ShaderGraph (URP)

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/zt21itB0ESw) you will learn how blend between 2 (or more) textures using Vertex Colors. This gives you a similar experience to using the Terrain Tools to paint on a Terrain, but on a mesh!

To achieve the painting, we're using [PolyBrush](https://unity.com/features/polybrush), a free Unity Package. To subdivide objects to ensure high enough polygon count for the Vertex Colors, we're using [ProBuilder](https://unity.com/features/probuilder), another free Unity Package.

## Requirements
* This was implemented with Universal Render Pipeline, but it works on Built-in and HDRP as well.
* I'm using Unity 2022.3 LTS, but this functionality should be working on pretty much any modern version of Unity that support:
  * PolyBrush (included in Unity Package Manager dependencies)
  * ProBuilder (included in Unity Package Manager dependencies)
  * ShaderGraph (included in Unity Package Manager dependencies)
